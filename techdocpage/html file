        Welcome to my fake technical documentation page! It is very fake as you can see. It meets all the requirements of a technical documentation page without any of the actual information to make this page useful
      </p>

      My name is Craig by the way. And here is some code:
      <code
        >x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
      </code>
      Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it do the math. That's fun, right?

      lets talk about math!
      <p>
        This is how you set up a variable <code>var x = 42.</code> In this case, x equals 42
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also take out the "var" in there <code>x = 42.</code> That looks better
      </p>
      <p>
        set up another variable<code> let y = 13.</code> that's lit
      </p>
    </article>
      <p>
        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
        global variable in Javascript. Now that's a useful fact! I finally gave you something useful!
      </p>

      <p>
        One more bit of code, a script element that helps set up javascript:
      </p>
      <code>document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";</code>
      <p>
        And that's all. yay
